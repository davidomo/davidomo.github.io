			Here's a little bit about me. Not too much though as I usually choose not to divulge too much information about myself. Today, I am not happy about my clothing choices as I have chosen to wear a light grey with a very, very light beige pant. Even the jacket I am wearing is grey, as if I was colorblind this morning or just lost my senses.

			Now I will ocntinue on. Not in a manner where I explain about myself. More a stream of consciousness. It's funny, works like this have happened. JD Salinger wrote <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> as almost a stream of thoughts of a troubled young man. I used to love that book. Now, I'm too afraid to read it again. i've changed, and that angsty, rebellious teen that I was may not be the same person who reads it. I'm scared, truely, that I have become too dark and cynical in my way-too-young-to-be-truly-middle-aged mindset.
